All my music players (Spotify, XBMC, Rythmbox etc...) are [scrobbling][1] over [lastfm][2] but not all of them display song lyrics properly so I came up with a quick Google AppEngine app that grab the latest or current song scrobbled over Â last.fm and display its lyrics. No fancy HTML or javascript just the lyrics displayed for your enjoyment.

This is available here :

<http://getlastlastfmlyrics.appspot.com/>

for the scripter around you can just get (via curl or other) :

http://getlastlastfmlyrics.appspot.com/?u=username

and it will automatically display it for that username.
