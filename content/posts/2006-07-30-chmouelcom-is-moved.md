I have finally changed chmouel.com over a new provider. The new  
provider is called [WebHost][1] and i got a [VPS][2] with 50GB of  
bandwith and 2GB of storage for 10US$ a month.

My first task was to compile python2.4 on that box which look like  
it's based on RH7.3 with heavy customization. Hopefully python really can compile everywhere.

I would like to thanks [Vincent Danen][3] for all his free hosting  
during all theses years. He has been answering me every  
questions i had and provided me a nice hosting for all theses years i was in travel.  
I hope to pass by Alberta one day and invite him for the couples  
of hundred beers that i own him now.

So now that i have a private server what can i do with that ? not too  
much since webdev is not my hobbies (i have to do that at work and i  
find it a pain in the a\***), but well it's cool to have a ssh  
from everywhere in the world.
