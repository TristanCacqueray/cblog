I am lucky to sit in front of [Julien Danjou][1] at work and as the sole Emacs users on the side of our office it was come to our attention that we needed as emacsian to unite ourselves to preach the good parole of the [church of Emacs][2] and [sexy mens.][3]

It was quite obvious that the only way to convince those in the unkown was to find an excuse for drinks good food between good people and set-up a meetup.

And since [eNovance][4] have now a very new [fancy office][5] with a large room to organise geeky (or not) oriented meetups, it was just a perfect time.

Within three clicks, three steps of dancing and after 10 minutes trying to do that straight from Emacs before coming back to a modern web browser (Emacs users are pragmatic) the [Parisian OpenStack User Group][6]  
opened.

This is with great success, In less than 5 days we had already 50 members and an informal drink-up organised for thursday.

So if you are based in Paris and you have a love for Emacs or just want to discover what's that all about come [join the group][6].
