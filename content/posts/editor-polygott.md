I remember the first time when I decided that "Emacs" will be my editor. I was
trying multiple Linux editors at the time and "Emacs" was only one who had a
graphical interface. And even tho the weird background was a bit weird at the
time, I found it much easier to use compared to "PICO" (which was using with my
mail client Pine) and "VI". There was another popular editor on X11 called
["NEdit"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEdit) but the motif based widget was
even more alien to me than "Emacs" as someone who was just used to use Windows
3.11 (oh dear).

It took me quite some time to be proficient with Emacs lisp and generally with
the editor. I think I used for quite a while Emacs just by copy and pasting and
hacking things around. But finally I get there and until now my vim config
with modern configuration and tool. I am going to state the obvious, but Emacs is
truly the extendable editor. You can really do anything you can think of with
Emacs, and only limited by your imagination.

After that in my career, when I became a Devops Engineer, managing a fleet of
servers I became used to using ["Vim"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim) and I
spend enough time with it to get used to it.
