I have released a python binding to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/dns/" title="DNSaas" target="_blank">Rackspace CloudDNS</a> here which allow you to create/update/delete domains and records. It's available on github

<a href="https://github.com/rackspace/python-clouddns/" target="_blank">https://github.com/rackspace/python-clouddns/</a>

The binding is pretty simple and have unfortunately no documentation (or even tests) but you can figure out most of it from here :

<a href="https://github.com/rackspace/python-clouddns/blob/master/tests/t.py" target="_blank">https://github.com/rackspace/python-clouddns/blob/master/tests/t.py</a>

I will be very welcoming pull request that add a bit of documentation.
