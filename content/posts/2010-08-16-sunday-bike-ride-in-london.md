This post is literally to test the embedding track feature from Garmin Connect ..... 

This is a easy bike ride, it start from Ealing to to Decathlon in Canada water and stop in Parsons-Green on my way back to watch Liverpool-Arsenal at mates place before coming back home, my pace was kind of slow since I have a broken thumb and I am trying to respect London traffic now and stop at traffic lights ;-)

Garmin Forerunner 305 is awesome device by the way if you are doing a lot of outdoor Running / Cycling, I have just ordered the footpod accessory to track my workout when I play football or on a treadmill.
