To rename bunch of files via regexp i was using before a homegrown python script call [rename-regexp.py][1]{#p38} to change bunch of files with a regexp.

But since then i discovered [wdired][2] which is pretty fantastic to use that from emacs. With the [extended][3] _\`\`query-replace-regexp\`\`_ from Emacs22 stuff are much easier to rename.
