I don't really use much the GUI and always the command line so I don't really use the Cloud File plugin I created for nautilus.

So here is a shell script to upload to Rackspace Cloud Files and give you back a shortened URL of the public URL file. Great for quick sharing... You have to install the zenity binary first..
